Hill Cipher Algorithm

1- Whats Hill Cipher ?

The Hill cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher built on concepts from Linear Algebra. The Hill cipher makes use of modulo arithmetic, matrix multiplication, and matrix inverses; hence, it is a more mathematical cipher than others. The Hill cipher is also a block cipher, so, theoretically, it can work on arbitrary sized blocks.

Encryption
1. Convert message into pairs of 2 rows and multiple columns, number of columns is total length of message divided by 2
2. Take a 4 letter key and convert it into 2x2 matrix
3. Perform matrix multiplication between each row and column pair of message and 2x2 key matrix
4. Take modulo 26 of result to obtain cipher text letter

Decryption
1. Convert message into pairs of 2 rows and multiple columns, number of columns is total length of message divided by 2
2. Take a 4 letter key and convert it into 2x2 matrix
3. Find determinant of the key matrix
4. find multiplicative inverse of the determinant ofkey matrix
5. find adjugate matrix of key matrix
6. multiply multiplicative inverse of determinant with adjugate matrix and take mod 26 of result
7. Perform matrix multiplication between each row and column pair of message and 2x2 key matrix
8. Take modulo 26 of result to obtain cipher text letter
